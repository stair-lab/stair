My current work with STAIR the lab explores LLMs in stratigic settings. It is interested in whether LLM agents leverage concrete knowledge from pre-training or attempt to “reason from scratch” when facing novel enviorments. We initally modeled by their actions in 2-player multi-turn Matrix games.

In prior work with the lab while at UIUC [2017-2020] we collaborated on inductive biases for generative models. Including model regularizations to induce fairness properties and latent space disentanglement.
