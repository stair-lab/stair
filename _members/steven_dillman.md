Steven Dillmann is a second-year PhD student at Stanford University specializing in AI for Science. Advised by Sanmi Koyejo (Computer Science) and Risa Wechsler (Physics), his research sits at the intersection of machine learning and the natural sciences. His current work focuses on three key areas: (i) multi-modal, data-based foundation models for science, (ii) AI agents for scientific discovery, and (iii) evaluating frontier models and agents on scientific workflows.

Currently, Steven leads [Terminal-Bench-Science](https://github.com/harbor-framework/terminal-bench-science), an extension of the popular [Terminal-Bench](https://www.tbench.ai/) project designed to evaluate AI agents in real-world, terminal-based scientific workflows across various fields in the natural sciences.

Before joining Stanford, Steven earned an MPhil in Data Intensive Science from the University of Cambridge and an MEng in Aerospace Engineering from Imperial College London. His background includes internships and research at NASA JPL, Harvard, the European Space Agency, Amazon, Airbus, and BMW, where he applied scientific machine learning to problems in astronomy and aerospace engineering.
