## Research

Our research interests span three interconnected areas:

### AI Measurement Science

How do we know if AI systems are performing well, behaving fairly, or meeting safety requirements? We develop principled approaches to measuring AI capabilities, limitations, and impacts. This includes work on evaluation metrics, benchmarking methodologies, and understanding what our measurements actually tell us about AI systems.

### Trustworthy AI and Society

We study the foundations of building AI systems that are reliable, fair, and aligned with human values. Our work addresses:
- **Fairness**: Developing algorithms and metrics for equitable AI
- **Robustness**: Making AI systems reliable under distribution shift and adversarial conditions
- **Privacy**: Protecting sensitive information in machine learning pipelines
- **Federated Learning**: Training models across distributed data while preserving privacy and security

### Applications and Real-World Impact

We apply our research to high-stakes domains including:
- **Healthcare**: Clinical prediction models, medical imaging analysis
- **Neuroscience**: Understanding brain function through fMRI and cognitive modeling
- **Scientific Discovery**: Accelerating research through reliable AI tools
